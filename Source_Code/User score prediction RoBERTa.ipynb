Ya'll wrong, the reason why I really hate the game is because of how they deliver the story and how they force you to like a specific character that should've not been there in the first place. For those who played and loved the first one will get my point. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN JOEL AND ELLIE!,Clearly ND and Neil Druckmann is forcing the game to transition the characters so they could imply their beliefs about feminism and other \\\"woke\\\" stuff. We all know it and we all have seen it. I so **** love the first game that I cannot help myself but to feel bitter and hate about this one. There are so many ways to narrate and deliver the story. And no, i don't have issues about Joel's death I just hope they should've delivered it in a much much better way. I ain't no professional.

Story is very well written but is an adult and kind of sad story (as one of the best movies you've seen)... Naugthy Dog made one of a hell violent game but with a price... so they decided to make players think about deep stuff as revenge... or losing someone special.,,10/10 for me , Ellie is one of the most human characters you can find out there.,And if you don't like the plot it's still lot of fun to play\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          5,\n          1,\n          7\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":21}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.shape"],"metadata":{"id":"01VL_GAIYs6T","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719600410384,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Víctor Fernández Florensa","userId":"16048359902230625504"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"24166b6d-7fc3-4761-e2c0-a805bd1a09ca"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(30726, 2)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":22}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from datasets import Dataset\n","from transformers import RobertaTokenizer\n","\n","train_df, test_df = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n","\n","# Crear datasets HuggingFace a partir de los DataFrames de Pandas\n","train_dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(train_df)\n","test_dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(test_df)\n","print(train_dataset)\n","print(test_dataset)"],"metadata":{"id":"mZOW7wnkN4HV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719600412406,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":2027,"user":{"displayName":"Víctor Fernández Florensa","userId":"16048359902230625504"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"df4e9a1c-bffa-41cf-deb5-62a6e092155e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Dataset({\n","    features: ['review', 'score', '__index_level_0__'],\n","    num_rows: 24580\n","})\n","Dataset({\n","    features: ['review', 'score', '__index_level_0__'],\n","    num_rows: 6146\n","})\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from transformers import RobertaTokenizer\n","tokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained('roberta-large')\n","\n","def tokenize_function(examples):\n","    return tokenizer(examples['review'], padding=\"max_length\", truncation=True)\n","\n","train_dataset = train_dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)\n","test_dataset = test_dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"wMLKzkZ2vSHn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719600478885,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":66487,"user":{"displayName":"Víctor Fernández Florensa","userId":"16048359902230625504"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":141,"referenced_widgets":["92c46c45af754e48ae1d2757b722d3c6","8fdfa4018c39409bb36dbc12fb2081ca","918437dd6fde42d79ff54ae6598e3734","b54a09b0425947d2b0b60398ebd6fec6","03121d47b0d6445fbb6f553c85f3dc07","8700d03b326546f88351f837252015e9","aa987c2d8d77470284469b91eb406a0c","36ec0194335040ecaec72ee15bb2ebd5","5eee2361c214434d8b01123aa5077851","158da77f3e2648af84ecfb23e6b55f38","0082488736554beb8f2d57896a4b257d","83b4b7b4007c46f19f77b81148d07d42","c6504d30edec48d3bd3bec0ee0457ec3","4f61c94124d24508860f54884acd67ed","ab60438eef174b5ead663e8fc2ae29f4","6e7cd9fe042348538ea07537b53ebc2d","90d7f70933624455a5d4223a4f751250","2fdb58343dc94bc991628fff4de8a918","f17960f06e7c43b1b063b6a54a290783","9a0145ad09ac46f7a4b0ccb3e773824e","4a14d993631341a686071727502daf3d","e19d9b1a893843489d36cd3264ae8948"]},"outputId":"0f04aea8-8b51-47ff-da8c-944b72a0063d"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/huggingface_hub/utils/_token.py:89: UserWarning: \n","The secret `HF_TOKEN` does not exist in your Colab secrets.\n","To authenticate with the Hugging Face Hub, create a token in your settings tab (https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), set it as secret in your Google Colab and restart your session.\n","You will be able to reuse this secret in all of your notebooks.\n","Please note that authentication is recommended but still optional to access public models or datasets.\n","  warnings.warn(\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Map:   0%|          | 0/24580 [00:00<?, ?
